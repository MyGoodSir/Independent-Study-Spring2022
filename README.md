# Independent Study in Discrete Differential Geometry 
### Conducted by Joseph Adrian during the spring of 2022. 
### Supervised by Dr. Ziying Tang
This repository contains the coursework, projects, and papers I have produced related to my independent study of Discrete Differential Geometry.

The template code for the programming exercises was taken from the [DDG course](https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2022/) taught by [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/index.html) at [CMU](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/).
More information, and full, proper credits, can be found in the `README.md` file in the `ddg-exercises-js` subdirectory of this repository.
